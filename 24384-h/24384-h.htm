<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="JANUARY" id="JANUARY"></a>JANUARY.</h2>

<h4>1.&mdash;Stewed Breast of Lamb.</h4>

<p>Cut a breast of lamb into small pieces, season, and stew until tender in
enough gravy to cover the meat. Thicken the sauce, flavor with a
wine-glass of wine, pile in the centre of a platter and garnish with
green peas.</p>

<h4>2.&mdash;Chicken Creams.</h4>

<p>Chop and pound &frac12; a lb. of chicken and 3 ozs. of ham; pass this through
a sieve, add 1 oz. of melted butter, 2 well-beaten eggs, and &frac12; a pint
of cream, which must be whipped; season with pepper and salt. Mix all
lightly together, put into oiled moulds and steam fifteen minutes, or if
in one large mould half an hour.</p>

<h4>3.&mdash;Herring's Roes on Toast.</h4>

<p>Have rounds of toast buttered and seasoned with salt and pepper, on each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>piece place &frac12; the soft roe of a herring which has been slightly fried
and on the top of this a fried mushroom. Serve very hot.</p>

<h4>4.&mdash;French Omelet.</h4>

<p>For a very small omelet beat 2 whole eggs and the yokes of two more
until a full spoonful can be taken up. Add 3 tablespoonfuls of water,
&frac14; of a teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of pepper, and when well mixed
turn into a hot omelet pan, in which a tablespoonful of butter has been
melted, lift the edges up carefully and let the uncooked part run under.
When all is cooked garnish with parsley.</p>

<h4>5.&mdash;Cheese Ramequins.</h4>

<p>Melt 1 oz. of butter, mix with &frac12; oz. of flour, add &frac14; of a pint of
milk, stir and cook well. Then beat in the yolks of two eggs, sprinkle
in 3 ozs. of grated cheese, add the well-beaten whites of three eggs.
Mix in lightly and put in cases. Bake a quarter of an hour.</p>

<h4>6.&mdash;Scotch Collops.</h4>

<p>Cut cold roast veal into thin slices, and dust over them a little mace,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>nutmeg, cayenne, and salt, and fry them in a little butter. Lay on a
dish and make a gravy by adding 1 tablespoonful of flour, &frac14; of a pint
of water, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 tablespoonful of lemon
juice, &frac14; of a teaspoonful of lemon peel, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream,
and 1 of sherry. Let boil up once and pour over the meat. Garnish with
lemon and parsley.</p>

<h4>7.&mdash;Orange Salad.</h4>

<p>Slice 3 sweet oranges, after removing the skin and pith, make a dressing
with 3 tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a tablespoonful of lemon juice, and
a pinch of salt. Serve on lettuce leaves.</p>

<h4>8.&mdash;Oyster Potpie.</h4>

<p>Scald one quart of oysters in their own liquor. When boiling take out
the oysters and keep them hot. Stir together a tablespoonful of butter
and two of flour, and moisten with cold milk. Add two small cups of
boiling water to the oyster liquor, season with salt and pepper, and
stir in the flour mixture, and let it cook until it thickens like cream.
Make a light biscuit dough and cut out with a thimble. Drop these into
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> boiling mixture, cover the saucepan and cook until the dough is
done. Put the oysters on a hot dish and pour biscuit balls and sauce
over them.</p>

<h4>9.&mdash;Chicken Cutlets.</h4>

<p>Chop cold chicken fine; season with onion-juice, celery salt, pepper,
and chopped parsley. For 2 cupfuls allow a cupful of cream or rich milk.
Heat this (with a bit of soda stirred in) in a saucepan, and thicken
with a tablespoonful of butter rubbed in, one of corn-starch, stirred in
when the cream is scalding. Cook one minute, put in the seasoned
chicken, and cook until smoking hot. Beat two eggs light; take the
boiling mixture from the fire and add gradually to these. Pour into a
broad dish or agate-iron pan and set in a cold place until perfectly
chilled and stiff. Shape with your hands, or with a cutter, into the
form of cutlets or chops. Dip in egg, then in cracker-crumbs. Set on the
ice an hour or two and fry in deep boiling fat. Send around white sauce
with them.&mdash;From "The National Cook Book," by Marion Harland and
Christine Terhune Herrick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<h4>10.&mdash;Cocoanut Ice Cream.</h4>

<p>Put 1 pint of milk over the fire in a double boiler with the grated
yellow rind of a lemon and three well-beaten eggs. Stir until the
mixture begins to thicken. Remove from the fire; add a cup and a half of
sugar, and 1 qt. of cream. Then add a grated cocoanut. Stir until the
custard is cold, add the lemon juice and freeze.</p>

<h4>11.&mdash;Loaf Corn Bread.</h4>

<p>Mix together 2 cupfuls of corn-meal, 1 cupful of flour, 1 teaspoonful of
salt, and 2 of baking powder. Beat together 3 eggs until thick and
light. Add 2&frac12; cupfuls of milk and stir into the dry mixture, adding 2
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and
beating well until the batter is smooth. Grease the pans well, or it
will stick. Have the batter a little more than 2 inches deep in the pans
and bake in a hot oven for about half an hour.&mdash;"Table Talk," Phila.</p>

<h4>12.&mdash;Beef Ragout.</h4>

<p>Cut cold roast beef into large slices. Put it into a saucepan with 2
slices of onion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> salt and pepper. Pour over it &frac12; a pt. of boiling
water and add 3 tablespoonfuls of soup stock. Stew gently until cooked.</p>

<h4>13.&mdash;Curried Rice.</h4>

<p>Boil 1 cup of rice rapidly for half an hour, drain in a colander and
stand in the oven for a few minutes to dry out the rice. Put 2
tablespoonfuls of butter and a slice of onion into a saucepan. Stir
until the onion is a golden brown, add a tablespoonful of flour. (Take
out the slice of onion.) Stir until smooth, then add a teaspoonful of
curry powder, bring to a boil, add salt. Pour over the rice and serve
hot.</p>

<h4>14.&mdash;Tapioca Soup.</h4>

<p>One qt. of veal or chicken broth, 1 pt. of cream or milk, 1 onion, a
little celery, 1/3 of a cupful of tapioca, 2 cupfuls of cold water, 1
tablespoonful of butter, a small piece of mace, salt and pepper. Wash
and soak the tapioca over night. Cook it in the broth for an hour. Cook
milk, onion, mace and celery together for 15 minutes, then strain into
the tapioca and broth; add the butter, salt and pepper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h4>15.&mdash;Haddock Roes and Bacon.</h4>

<p>Haddock roes are much cheaper than shad roes, and are very nice prepared
in this way. Soak for an hour in water and lemon juice, then parboil in
salt and water for ten minutes. Fry brown in a little lard and butter
mixed. Fry the bacon in a separate pan until brown, remove from the pan
and put it in the oven for a few minutes to crisp it. Put the roes in
the centre of a hot platter and garnish the bacon around it.</p>

<h4>16.&mdash;Rice Moulds.</h4>

<p>Wash a teacupful of rice in several waters, put it into a saucepan and
just cover with cold water, and when it boils, add two cupfuls of milk,
and boil until it becomes dry; put it into a mould and press it well.
When cold serve with a garnish of preserves around it or with a boiled
custard.</p>

<h4>17.&mdash;English Muffins.</h4>

<p>Scald 1 pt. of milk and add 1 oz. of butter and let cool; when cool add
&frac14; of a yeast cake, a teaspoonful of salt and three cups of flour, beat
well, cover and let rise about two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> hours. When light, add sufficient
flour to make a soft dough; work lightly and divide into small balls;
put each one into a well-greased muffin ring and let rise again. Then
bake on a hot griddle. When ready to eat tear them open and butter.</p>

<h4>18.&mdash;Minced Veal and Macaroni.</h4>

<p>Mince &frac34; of a lb. of cold veal and 3 ozs. of ham, wet with 1
tablespoonful of gravy. Season with salt and pepper, a little nutmeg, a
quarter of a lb. of bread crumbs and a well-beaten egg. Butter a mould
and line it with some boiled macaroni. Mix more macaroni with the veal
mixture, fill the mould, put a plate on it and steam for &frac12; an hour.
Turn out carefully, pour a good brown gravy <i>around</i> it.</p>

<h4>19.&mdash;Baked Beans and Tomato Salad.</h4>

<p>Stir 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar very gradually into 6 tablespoonfuls of
oil and a dash of paprika. Add salt, if the beans have not been
seasoned. The oil and vinegar will not unite perfectly. Pour gradually
over a pint of cold baked beans such portions of the dressing as they
will absorb, toss together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> and arrange on a serving dish. Make a border
of sliced tomatoes around the beans and over these pour the rest of the
dressing.&mdash;Janet Hill in "Boston Cooking School Magazine."</p>

<h4>20.&mdash;Tomato Croquettes.</h4>

<p>Stew together for 20 minutes &frac12; a can of tomatoes, 1 tablespoonful of
chopped onion, 1 sprig of parsley, &frac12; a bay leaf, 4 cloves and enough
salt and pepper to season highly. Rub through a sieve. In a clean
saucepan melt together 2 tablespoonfuls of butter and 5 tablespoonfuls
of flour. Add 2 cupfuls of the strained tomato and stir and cook for ten
minutes. Take from the fire and set aside until cold. Flour the hands
and carefully mould into small croquettes. Dip each into slightly beaten
egg and roll in fine bread crumbs. Let stand for 20 minutes, then repeat
the dipping and rolling in crumbs. Fry at once in very hot fat and drain
on unglazed paper.&mdash;"Table Talk," Phila.</p>

<h4>21.&mdash;Eggs on Rice.</h4>

<p>Cover a platter an inch deep with hot well-boiled rice, to which has
been added 1 table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>spoonful of melted butter. On this serve six
well-poached eggs. Garnish with parsley.</p>

<h4>22.&mdash;Baked Celery.</h4>

<p>Parboil a bunch of celery, using only the stalks; cut into two inch
lengths, put them into a baking dish. Rub smooth 2 tablespoonfuls of
butter and 2 of flour, then beat in the yolks of 3 eggs; stir this into
1 qt. of veal stock and pour it over the celery, cover with grated bread
crumbs and dust the top with grated cheese.</p>

<h4>23.&mdash;Stewed Steak and Oyster Sauce.</h4>

<p>Wash 1 pt. of small oysters in a little water, drain into a saucepan and
put this water on to heat. As soon as it comes to a boil skim and set
back. Put 3 tablespoonfuls of butter into a frying pan and when hot, put
in 2 lbs. of round steak; cook ten minutes. Take out the steak and sift
1 tablespoonful of flour into the butter, stir until browned. Add the
oyster liquor and boil 1 minute, season; put back the steak, cover and
simmer &frac12; an hour, then add the oysters and 1 tablespoonful lemon
juice. Boil for 1 minute and serve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<h4>24.&mdash;Barley Stew.</h4>

<p>Cut &frac12; a lb. of cold meat into dice; wash &frac14; of a cupful of barley,
chop 2 onions very fine, put all into a saucepan and dredge with flour,
season with salt and pepper. Add a qt. of water and simmer about 2
hours. Pare and slice 5 potatoes, add them to the stew and simmer an
hour longer.</p>

<h4>25.&mdash;Bread Omelet.</h4>

<p>Beat 3 eggs separately. To the yolks add &frac12; a cup of milk, pinch of
salt, pepper and &frac12; a cup of bread crumbs. Cut into this very carefully
the well beaten whites; mix lightly. Put 1 tablespoonful of butter into
a frying pan; and as soon as it is hot turn in the mixture. Set it over
a good fire, being careful not to burn. When half done, set the pan in
the oven for a few minutes to set the middle of the omelet. Turn onto a
hot platter and serve.</p>

<h4>26.&mdash;Calf's Liver Fried in Crumbs.</h4>

<p>Wash and parboil slices of liver, then roll each piece, in crumbs, then
in beaten egg, then in crumbs again. Fry in hot lard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<h4>27.&mdash;Toad in a Hole.</h4>

<p>Cut 1 pt. of meat into 1 inch pieces and put them into a greased baking
dish. Beat 2 eggs very light, add to it 1 pint of milk and pour it
gradually into 6 tablespoonfuls of flour, beating all the time. Strain,
add salt and pepper and pour it over the meat. Bake an hour and serve at
once.</p>

<h4>28.&mdash;Shrimp Salad.</h4>

<p>Shell 1 can of shrimps, arrange on lettuce leaves, serve with French
dressing.</p>

<h4>29.&mdash;Creamed Corn Beef.</h4>

minutes, stirring until thickened and then occasionally add a dash of
paprika and strain over 1 pt. of cold cooked corn beef, cut into cubes.
Turn into a pudding dish and cover with half a cup of cracker crumbs,
mixed with 3 tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Set into the oven to
reheat and brown the crumbs.&mdash;Janet M. Hill in "Boston Cooking School
Magazine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<h4>30.&mdash;Potted Beef.</h4>

<p>Take the outside slices left from boiled or braised beef, cut up into
small pieces and pound it thoroughly with a little butter in a mortar;
add salt, pepper and a little powdered mace. Mix thoroughly. Put it into
jelly glasses, pour a coating of clarified butter over the top. Cover
with paper until wanted.</p>

<h4>31.&mdash;Carolina Philpes.</h4>

<p>One gill of rice, boiled soft; when cold, rub it with a spoon. Moisten
with water a gill of rice flour, and mix it with the rubbed rice. Beat 1
egg, very light, and stir in. Bake on a shallow tin plate, split and
butter while hot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FEBRUARY" id="FEBRUARY"></a>FEBRUARY.</h2>

<h4>1.&mdash;Oyster Loaf.</h4>

<p>Take a loaf of bread, cut off the crusts, dig out the centre, making a
box of it, brush it all over with melted butter and put into the oven to
brown. Fill with creamed oysters, cover the top with fried bread crumbs,
put into the oven for a minute and serve. Garnish with parsley.</p>

<h4>2.&mdash;Broiled Sweetbreads.</h4>

<p>For these use veal sweetbreads. Wash and parboil them and cut in half
lengthwise. When cold, season with salt and pepper, and pour over them a
little melted butter. Broil over a clear fire about 5 minutes. Serve
with melted butter and chopped parsley poured over them.</p>

<h4>3.&mdash;Liver and Onions.</h4>

<p>Take 1 lb. of liver, cover it with boiling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> water and let it stand for
five minutes, then cut it into dice. Into a frying pan put 3 slices of
fat bacon and fry. When the fat is fried out add the liver and 4 onions,
sliced thin; cook until done. Add a tablespoonful of flour, salt, and
pepper. Mix well and serve.</p>

<h4>4.&mdash;Broiled Beef and Mushroom Sauce.</h4>

<p>Stew &frac12; a can of mushrooms in 1 oz. of butter, salt, and cayenne
pepper. Have ready mashed potatoes. Put them in a mound in the centre of
a hot dish; make a hole in the centre, pour in the mushrooms, lay
against the outside of the mound slices of cold roast beef.</p>

<h4>5.&mdash;Kornlet Omelet.</h4>

<p>Melt 1 tablespoonful of butter; cook in this 1 tablespoonful of flour,
&frac14; of a tablespoonful each of salt and pepper, then add gradually &frac12; a
cup of kornlet. When the mixture boils, remove from the fire and stir in
the yolks of three eggs beaten until thick, then fold in the whites of
the eggs beaten dry. Turn into an omelet pan, in which two
tablespoonfuls of butter have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> melted. Spread evenly in the pan and
let cook until "set" on the bottom, then put into the oven. When a knife
cut down into the omelet comes out clean, score across the top at right
angles to the handle of the pan. Fold and turn onto a heated
dish.&mdash;Janet M. Hill, in "Boston Cooking School Magazine."</p>

<h4>6.&mdash;Liver Rolls.</h4>

<p>Have &frac12; a lb. of calf's liver cut in thin slices, parboil for 5
minutes, wipe each piece dry, lay a thin slice of bacon on each slice of
liver, season with salt and pepper, roll up and fasten with a wooden
toothpick, dredge with flour and fry until done in bacon fat or
drippings. When done take out the rolls and thicken the gravy with a
little brown flour. If there is not gravy enough add a little boiling
water. A teaspoonful of mushroom catsup added to the gravy is an
improvement or a squeeze of onion juice.</p>

<h4>7.&mdash;A Box of Chestnuts.</h4>

<p>Shell 1 qt. of chestnuts and cover with boiling water; leave them for
fifteen minutes, then rub off the brown skins. Put them into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> a
saucepan, cover them with soup stock and let them boil &frac12; an hour; when
done, drain. Save the stock. Into a frying pan put 1 tablespoonful of
butter and when melted add 1 of flour; cook until browned, then add the
stock and stir until it boils; add salt and pepper to taste. Lay the
chestnuts in a box made of fried bread and pour the sauce over.</p>

<p>To make the box, take a loaf of bread, cut off the crust and leave the
sides as smooth as possible. Cut out the centre, leaving a box shaped
piece. Fry this in deep fat.</p>

<h4>8.&mdash;Curried Hare.</h4>

<p>Clean and cut the hare or rabbit as for fricassee. Simmer slowly in just
enough water to cover, add a thickening of 1 tablespoonful each of
butter and flour, season with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoonful of curry
powder.</p>

<h4>9.&mdash;Scrambled Eggs with Shad Roes.</h4>

<p>When you have shad for dinner scald the roes ten minutes in boiling
water (salted), drain, throw into cold water, leave them there three
minutes, wipe dry, and set in a cold place until you wish to use them.
Cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> them across into pieces an inch or more wide, roll them in flour,
and fry to a fine brown. Scramble a dish of eggs, pile the roes in the
centre of a heated platter, and dispose the eggs in a sort of hedge all
around them.&mdash;From "The National Cook Book," by Marion Harland and
Christine Terhune Herrick.</p>

<h4>10.&mdash;Chicken in Celery Sauce.</h4>

<p>Take the roots of a bunch of celery, clean and cut it into small pieces,
put them into a saucepan and cover with cold water, about a pint, stew
slowly and when tender put through a vegetable press. Into a saucepan
put 1 tablespoonful each of flour and butter. When melted and rubbed
smooth add &frac12; a cup of milk and the celery. Stir well and when it boils
add salt and pepper. Have 1 pt. of cold chicken cut into dice, and add
them to the boiling sauce when all is hot. Serve with toast points.</p>

<h4>11.&mdash;Fig Ice Cream.</h4>

<p>Put 3&frac12; cupfuls of milk in a double boiler and as soon as it comes to
a boil stir in two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch that has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> mixed
with &frac12; a cupful of cold milk. Cook for ten minutes. Beat together 3
eggs and a cup and a half of sugar. Pour the cooked corn-starch and milk
on this, stirring all the time. Put back again on the fire, and add 1
tablespoonful of gelatine which has been dissolved in 4 tablespoonfuls
of cold water. Cook three minutes. Set away to cool. When cold add 1 pt.
of cream and 1 tablespoonful of vanilla and freeze. When the mixture has
been freezing for ten minutes, take off the cover and add 2 cupfuls of
chopped figs. Cover again and freeze hard.</p>

<h4>12.&mdash;Souffle Biscuit.</h4>

<p>Rub 4 ozs. of butter with a qt. of wheat flour, add a little salt. Make
it into a paste with &frac12; a pt. of milk. Knead it well: roll it as thin
as paper. Cut it out with a tumbler, and bake brown.</p>

<h4>13.&mdash;Fish Chowder.</h4>

<p>Put &frac14; of a lb. of bacon into a frying pan with 1 onion sliced; fry a
light brown. Into a saucepan put a layer of potatoes, a layer of fish,
then a few slices of the onion and bacon, then season. Continue until
all has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> been used. Add 1 qt. of water, cover and let simmer 20 minutes
without stirring. In a double boiler put 1 pt. of milk and break into it
6 water crackers; let it stand a few minutes then add to the chowder.
Let it boil up once and serve. Use 3 lbs. of chopped fish and 3 potatoes
for this.</p>

<h4>14.&mdash;Cold Duck and Chestnut-Border.</h4>

<p>Arrange slices of cold duck on a platter. Shell and blanch 1 qt. of
chestnuts, then boil until soft, drain and put them through a colander.
Add a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to taste, arrange around
the cold duck. Garnish with olives or bits of red currant jelly.</p>

<h4>15.&mdash;Oysters with Madeira Sauce.</h4>

<p>Into a saucepan put 2 tablespoonfuls of butter and 1 of flour, &frac12; a cup
of milk, a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of cayenne. Stir until smooth,
then add 25 oysters that have been washed and drained. When cooked take
from the stove and add 2 tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine.</p>

<h4>16.&mdash;Chicken Fritters.</h4>

<p>Season well, pieces of cold roast chicken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> Make a fritter batter, stir
the pieces in. Drop by spoonfuls into boiling fat. Lemon juice added to
the seasoning is an improvement.</p>

<h4>17.&mdash;Baked Rice Cake.</h4>

<p>One pt. of cold boiled rice, mixed with a cup of cold milk, 1 egg, about
&frac12; a pt. of flour just sufficient to hold it together. Put into a deep
pan and bake &frac12; an hour.</p>

<h4>18.&mdash;Cheese and Tomato Rarebit.</h4>

<h4>(Chafing Dish.)</h4>

<p>Put a tablespoonful of butter in the blazer and let the melted butter
run over the bottom. Then add 2 cups of cheese grated or cut into dice.
Stir until melted, then add the yolks of 2 eggs, beaten and diluted with
&frac12; a cup of tomato pur&eacute;e, &frac14; of a teaspoonful each of soda, salt, and
paprika. Stir constantly until the mixture is smooth, then serve on
bread toasted upon but one side.&mdash;Janet M. Hill in "Boston Cooking
School Magazine."</p>

<h4>19.&mdash;Onion Souffle.</h4>

<p>Cook 3 tablespoonfuls of flour in four of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> butter; add &frac12; a cup of

onions put through a sieve; add three eggs beaten very light. Turn into
a baking dish and stand in a pan of hot water. Bake &frac12; an hour.</p>

<h4>20.&mdash;Hungarian Chicken.</h4>

<p>Joint a fowl as for fricassee; put it on the fire in enough cold water
to cover it; bring it to a boil slowly, and cook until tender. Unless
